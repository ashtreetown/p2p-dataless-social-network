# P2P dataless social network

#### Concept

- Similar to a directory service
- A public platform with everyone on it
- No accounts, no adding friends, no feeds, etc
- All data is encrypted and kept client-side
- All sharing is done with end-to-end encryption
- Only real, actively verified people: no bots, no fake accounts, no companies or organizations, no duplicate profiles, etc
- Share a contact card, reconnect with people
- Introduce people to each other by passing on their contact card
- Abstract concepts such as "contact card" provides longevity if people stop using email or whatsapp or telegram or change their number
- Check regularly that users are still active and their contact card is still correct
- Instead of traditional search, users can find each other by explaining what they know about the other person and AI will figure out who they're talking about
